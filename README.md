I have created a full-stack API web app that doubles as personal blog about my journey to become a web developer, as well as an online portfolio. 

Currently the project is incomplete as I have not been successful rendering the styling changes I've made using Bootstrap and Sass.  The JS functionality is also pending completion.

I have yet to add my forms to the UI for User sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, change pw, as well as to post, edit and delete articles and comments -- all actions to line up with my backend.  So far, I've tested the backend running cURL scripts and they have been successful.

Final will be deployed here:  https://rails-blog-project.herokuapp.com/
